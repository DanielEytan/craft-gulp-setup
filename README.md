## Craft-Gulp-Setup
New Fancy Development Set-Uup for Craft and Gulp

## Setup
- All source files are in `src`.
- The `html` folder is the result of the source files and should not me checked in on git, only the src files should live there.
- We use autoprefixer. No need to add prefixes in the SCSS or CSS

## Installation
# Craft
- Download Craft (https://craftcms.com/) and drag the craft/app folder and craft/config/license.key file into your /craft destination
- Delete the rest of the downloaded Craft folder
- Create a database (UTF-8) for the project and edit the settings in /craft/config/db.php
- Edit the systemsâ€™s general configuration for your localhost in /craft/config/general.php
- Change the permissions for /craft/app, /craft/config and /craft/storage and their subfolders to 777 (only for localhost!)
